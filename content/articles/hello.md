Many years ago, I started my first blog while reading the book [Practical Reverse Engineering](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Practical-Reverse-Engineering-Reversing-Obfuscation/dp/1118787315) by Bruce Dang. The book had several exercises, and the author mentioned something along the lines of "*solve the exercises in this book and once you're done, hit me up - I wanna hire you*". Being keen to get into the industry, I worked through the problems and blogged my answers to the exercises. Although I never finished them, it contributed to me landing my first InfoSec job.

Several years passed without me contributing anything to my personal blog, even though there were times when I thought, "Ah, that would be a good blog article." Besides busyness being an excuse, part of the hiatus was because writing is difficult. It often showed me the gaps or contradictions in my thinking once I started trying to put together a coherent piece about something. Writing became just a way to create workplace artifacts like pentest reports, company blog posts, and technical documentation.

After reading a piece by [Leif Dreizler](https://leif.substack.com/p/share-the-spotlight-creating-a-culture) on sharing your work, something clicked, bringing back that fire to start writing a personal blog again. The article is filled with good reasons on why sharing your work is beneficial, but the point that rang most true to me was the following section:

>Think about how much time you've saved in your career because of open-source software, a pitfall you avoided because of something learned at a conference, or an approach you read about in a blog. InfoSec teams end up solving the same problems at different companies. Please allocate time in your team's busy schedule to allow people to share what they've learned.

So little of what I've accomplished can be attributed directly to me but rather to the knowledge that others have shared. On some of my more pensive days, it almost feels like a moral obligation to be an active participant in contributing back to the common knowledge of the field. So, hello world... again. Let's give blogging a second chance.
