HelloðŸ‘‹!

I'm Masande and I completed my degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Cape Town in 2015. My professional journey began as a Software Engineer, but switched to the InfoSec industry, where I cut my teeth as a pentester at MWR InfoSecurity. Having gained a few years of experience in offensive security in mobile, web, and cloud security, I decided to switch to the defensive side of the industry. Currently, I'm a Senior Security Engineer at Funding Circle, where I work on Product Security.

In the past, I have enjoyed doing security research in [mobile and cloud security](/research) and have presented at BSides Cape Town on [junk hacking](https://thecyberwire.com/glossary/junk-hack) as a way to learn about InfoSec, while having fun.
